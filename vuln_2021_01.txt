# CVE-2021-34687 (CWE-200)

RemotePC before 7.6.48 on Windows allows information disclosure. A man in the middle can recover a system's Personal Key when a client attempts to make a LAN connection. The Personal Key is only lightly, and reversibly, obfuscated before being transmitted over the network.

# CVE-2021-34688 (CWE-200)

RemotePC before 7.6.48 on Windows allows information disclosure. A locally authenticated attacker can read an encrypted version of the system's Personal Key in world-readable %PROGRAMDATA% log files. The encryption is done using a hard-coded static key and is therefore reversible by an attacker.

# CVE-2021-34689 (CWE-200)

RemotePC before 7.6.48 on Windows allows information disclosure. A locally authenticated attacker can read the system's Personal Key in world-readable %PROGRAMDATA% log file.

# CVE-2021-34690 (CWE-288)

RemotePC before 7.6.48 on Windows allows authentication bypass. A remote and unauthenticated attacker can bypass cloud authentication to connect and control a system via TCP port 5970 and 5980.

# CVE-2021-34691 (CWE-841)

RemotePC before 4.0.1 on Linux allows denial of service. A remote and unauthenticated attacker can disconnect a valid user session by connecting to an ephemeral port.

# CVE-2021-34692 (CWE-269)

RemotePC before 7.6.48 on Windows allows privilege escalation. A local and low-privileged user can force RemotePC to execute an attacker-controlled executable with SYSTEM privileges.
