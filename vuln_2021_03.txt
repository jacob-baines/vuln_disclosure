# CVE-2021-38085 (CWE-732)

The Canon TR150 print driver 3.71.2.10 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue. During the add printer process, a local attacker can overwrite a DLL and, if timed properly, the overwritten DLL will be loaded into a SYSTEM process resulting in escalation of privileges. This occurs because the driver drops a world-writable DLL into %PROGRAMDATA% that gets loaded bya system process.
